### 2. Self-Hosting with Docker

To self-host the Walletize server:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Walletize/server.git walletize-server
   cd walletize-server
   ```

2. Set up a PostgreSQL database:

   - Install PostgreSQL if you haven't already
   - Create a new database:
     ```bash
     createdb walletize
     ```
   - Or use Docker to run PostgreSQL:
     ```bash
     docker run --name walletize-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=walletize -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:14
     ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables, and adjust them accordingly (or copy `.env.example`):

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:5432/walletize"
   EXCHANGE_RATE_API_KEY="your-exchangerate-api-key" # Get your key at https://www.exchangerate-api.com
   WEB_URL="http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3101"
   USE_HTTPS="false" # Set to true if you are using HTTPS
   ```

4. Build and run the Docker container:

   ```bash
   docker build -t walletize-server .
   docker run -d -p 3100:3100 --name walletize-server walletize-server
   ```

5. The server will be running at `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3100`

After setting up the server, you'll need to set up the web application by following the instructions in the [Walletize/web](https://github.com/Walletize/web) repository.
